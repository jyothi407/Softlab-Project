# Softlab-Project
PROJECT OVERVIEW
Usually People have to go to canteens/food courts and order the foods and
they have to wait in queue for a long time to get the orders served. But with
the help of our system one just have to follow a very simple process to order
your items, and you need not to wait in the long queue either.Our system
also simplifies the ordering process and helps both customers and canteen
by providing appropriate functionalities.
The project automated canteen ordering and management system helps the
users to book their food earlier without any hassles.
One application is the university canteen itself where this application
provides such faster services to their students,Staff etc.
More applications would be in cafeterias, restaurants etc.
