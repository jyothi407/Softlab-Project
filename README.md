PROJECT OVERVIEW

Usually People have to go to canteens/food courts and order the foods and
they have to wait in queue for a long time to get the orders served. But with
the help of our system one just have to follow a very simple process to order
your items, and you need not to wait in the long queue either.Our system
also simplifies the ordering process and helps both customers and canteen
by providing appropriate functionalities.
The project automated canteen ordering and management system helps the
users to book their food earlier without any hassles.
One application is the university canteen itself where this application
provides such faster services to their students,Staff etc.
More applications would be in cafeterias, restaurants etc.

FROM THE CUSTOMERS’ END
Customers can order items, pay using cards or wallet money, contact canteen, provide personalized suggestions,check their balance, order history,add items to cart, delete the order from the cart,receive incentives  and many more features which the application aims for.This project will help in demonstrating the route from adapting materials to developing an online environment. This brings all necessities in one place that benefits both the user and the canteen owner smartly.

FROM THE CANTEENS’ END
This system also prominently relieves the burden on the canteen’s end, as the entire method of  taking orders is computerized. Once an order is placed, it is retrieved in pretty much real-time, by the application on the canteen’s end. Within this application, all items in the order are displayed, along with their equivalent options and supply details, in a summarizing and easy to read manner. This allows canteen staff to speedily go through the order with minimal delay and confusion.Once the order is served, the status of order will be changed and corresponding tables get updated.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

Canteen can see who are regular customers on a monthly basis i.e. those who order on a frequent basis and incentivize them.These reports will be generated dynamically for every month.
Bar-graphs are generated for number of orders received on days of a week ,which tell the canteen “which days of a week see heavy rush”  
Revenue generated for each day on a monthly basis is shown using a line chart for analysing the progress of the canteen.
Customers will receive a mail from the canteen through our application containing order summary including various dishes ordered,cost distribution,quantity distribution, and also the date and time at which order was placed and confirmed.
One can always check their past orders and transactions are recorded for confirmed orders which are stored in the database.
